## Description

SenseOSC is an innovative IoT (Internet of Things) solution specifically designed for use in dance art projects. The project harnesses the power of the Arduino Nicla Sense Me Bosch Microcontroller to gather real-time sensor data over Bluetooth Low Energy.

In addition to its core functionality of collecting environmental data, SenseOSC goes beyond traditional IoT applications by seamlessly integrating with Isadora, a powerful visual programming environment for interactive media. SenseOSC utilizes UPD (User Datagram Protocol) packets over Open Sound Control (OSC) to transmit sensor data directly to Isadora in real-time.

Isadora is a versatile software tool used by artists, performers, and creative technologists to create interactive and immersive multimedia experiences. With its intuitive interface and extensive capabilities for real-time audiovisual processing, Isadora serves as the perfect companion for SenseOSC in dance art projects.

### Key features of SenseOSC include

- **Plug-and-Play Compatibility:** SenseOSC is designed for ease of use, allowing users to quickly set up and deploy environmental sensors without the need for complex configurations or extensive technical expertise.

- **Seamless Integration with Isadora:** By leveraging UPD packets over OSC, SenseOSC enables direct communication with Isadora, empowering users to incorporate real-time sensor data into their dance art performances with ease.

- **Enhanced Creativity and Expression:** SenseOSC opens up new possibilities for artistic expression by providing dancers and choreographers with access to rich, dynamic sensor data. From interactive lighting effects triggered by movement to soundscapes that respond to environmental conditions, SenseOSC adds an extra layer of creativity to dance art projects.

SenseOSC is purposefully designed to bridge the gap between technology and art, empowering creators to explore the intersection of sensor technology, interactive media, and dance performance in innovative and meaningful ways. Whether you're a professional dancer, a multimedia artist, or an enthusiast exploring the boundaries of creative expression, SenseOSC invites you to unleash your imagination and transform your artistic vision into reality.
